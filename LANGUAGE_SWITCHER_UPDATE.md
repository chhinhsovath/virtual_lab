# Language Switcher Update Summary

## Changes Made

The language switcher on the homepage has been updated according to your requirements:

### ✅ What was changed:

1. **Removed flag emojis** (🇬🇧 🇰🇭) from all language toggle components
2. **Updated to show text labels only**: "ខ្មែរ" and "English"
3. **Confirmed Khmer as default language** - the system already defaults to Khmer

### 📋 Updated Components:

#### LanguageTogglePill (Used on Homepage)
- **Before**: Shows "🇬🇧 EN" and "🇰🇭 ខ្មែរ" with flags
- **After**: Shows "English" and "ខ្មែរ" without flags
- **Width**: Increased from w-24 to w-36 to accommodate full "English" text
- **Active background**: Adjusted to w-16 and repositioned for new layout

#### LanguageToggle (Standard Toggle)
- **Before**: Flag emoji (🇬🇧/🇰🇭) in center indicator
- **After**: Text abbreviations "EN"/"KH" in center indicator

#### LanguageToggleWithFlags (Dropdown Style)
- **Before**: Flag emoji with "EN"/"ខ្មែរ" labels
- **After**: Just "English"/"ខ្មែរ" text labels

### 🌐 Language System Confirmation:

The system is already properly configured with **Khmer as the default language**:

- `getUserLanguage()` function defaults to 'km' (Khmer)
- `getBrowserLanguage()` always returns 'km' for Cambodia Virtual Lab
- `LanguageProvider` initializes with 'km' as default
- All components respect this Khmer-first approach

### 🎯 Homepage Implementation:

The homepage (`/src/app/page.tsx`) uses the updated `LanguageTogglePill` component on line 232:

```tsx
<LanguageTogglePill />
```

### 🎨 Visual Result:

The language switcher now displays as a clean toggle with:
- Left side: "English" (when not selected: gray text, when selected: white text on gradient background)
- Right side: "ខ្មែរ" (when not selected: gray text, when selected: white text on gradient background)
- Smooth animation between states
- No flag emojis
- Khmer selected by default

The design maintains the same elegant pill-style appearance with gradient backgrounds and smooth transitions, but now shows clear text labels without any flag imagery.

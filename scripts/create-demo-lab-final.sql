    'üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
‚Ä¢ Understand the relationship between pendulum length and period
‚Ä¢ Investigate whether mass affects pendulum motion  
‚Ä¢ Explore the effect of gravity on pendulum behavior
‚Ä¢ Apply scientific method through controlled experimentation
‚Ä¢ Analyze experimental data and create graphs
‚Ä¢ Connect physics concepts to real-world applications

üß™ INTERACTIVE SIMULATION:
Students use PhET''s pendulum simulation with full Khmer language support to discover physics laws through hands-on experimentation.

üìä ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES:
1. Pre-lab predictions and hypothesis formation
2. Controlled experiments with data collection
3. Graph creation and pattern analysis
4. Lab report with conclusions and real-world connections

üá∞üá≠ CAMBODIAN CONTEXT:
This lab connects to traditional Cambodian temple bells, grandfather clocks, and modern timekeeping devices, helping students understand the physics behind familiar objects.

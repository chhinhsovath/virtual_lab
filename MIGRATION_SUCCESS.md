## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin** - Complete system control + user management
2. **Admin** - Full assessment and school data access
3. **Cluster Mentor** - Read-only access to assigned school clusters
4. **Teacher** - Read/write access to own school and subjects
5. **Viewer** - Read-only access to assigned schools

### Permission System
- **27 permissions** across 5 resource types:
  - User management (5 permissions)
  - Role management (5 permissions) 
  - Assessment management (5 permissions)
  - Student management (4 permissions)
  - School management (3 permissions)
  - Report access (2 permissions)
  - System administration (3 permissions)

### Security Features
- ✅ **bcrypt password hashing** (12 rounds)
- ✅ **Session-based authentication** with expiration
- ✅ **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- ✅ **School-level data isolation**
- ✅ **Audit logging** for all user activities
- ✅ **IP and user agent tracking**
- ✅ **Password reset functionality**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Login System
Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` and try:
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`

### 3. Verify Access Controls
- Check that users can only see their authorized schools
- Verify role-based permissions work correctly
- Test audit logging functionality

### 4. Production Preparation
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Review and adjust user permissions
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Configure session timeout policies
- [ ] Set up monitoring for failed login attempts

## 📊 Database Statistics

### Current Data Scale
- **Students**: 2,122,194 records
- **Teachers**: 63,128 records  
- **Schools**: 7,379 records
- **Users**: 28 accounts created
- **School Access**: 125 assignments

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Proper indexes on all lookup fields
- ✅ Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- ✅ Efficient query patterns for school filtering
- ✅ Minimal data loading for large datasets

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Updated
- ✅ `/api/auth/login` - New authentication
- ✅ `/api/auth/logout` - Session cleanup
- ✅ `/api/auth/session` - Session validation
- ✅ `/api/assessments` - Updated with permissions
- ✅ Authentication middleware updated

### Frontend Updates
- ✅ Login form updated for username/password
- ✅ Demo account buttons updated
- ✅ Session management improved

### Database Integration
- ✅ Works with existing `tbl_tarl_*` tables
- ✅ Maintains data integrity with foreign keys
- ✅ Scalable to full 2M+ student dataset

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Password Policy
- Default passwords provided for testing
- Production deployment requires password changes
- bcrypt hashing with 12-round salt

### Session Management
- 24-hour session expiration
- HTTP-only cookies for security
- IP and user agent tracking

### Access Control
- School-level data isolation enforced
- Permission-based action control
- Audit trail for all user activities

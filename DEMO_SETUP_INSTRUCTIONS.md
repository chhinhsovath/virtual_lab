#### **Step 3: Accessing the Pendulum Lab**
- Click on "Pendulum Physics Lab" assignment
- Show pre-lab questions and predictions
- Demonstrate how students submit hypotheses

**Narration:**
> "Before touching the simulation, មីហ្សា must make predictions. This activates prior knowledge and creates investment in the outcome. She thinks a heavier pendulum will swing faster - a common misconception we'll test."

#### **Step 4: Virtual Simulation Interaction**
- Open the pendulum simulation (`simulation_pendulum_lab_km.html`)
- Demonstrate key features:
  - **Parameter Controls:** Length, mass, gravity sliders
  - **Measurement Tools:** Timer, ruler, protractor
  - **Data Collection:** Automatic logging of experiments
  - **Visual Feedback:** Graphs and energy displays

**Interactive Demonstration:**
1. **Length Experiment**
   - Change pendulum length from 0.5m to 2.0m
   - Show how period increases with length
   - "មីហ្សា discovers that longer pendulums swing slower"

2. **Mass Experiment** 
   - Change mass from 0.5kg to 5.0kg
   - Show period remains constant
   - "Her prediction was wrong - mass doesn't affect swing time!"

3. **Gravity Experiment**
   - Switch from Earth to Moon gravity
   - Show dramatic slowdown in pendulum motion
   - "What would happen to clocks on the Moon?"

**Technical Features to Highlight:**
- Real-time physics simulation
- Accurate scientific modeling
- Bilingual labels and instructions
- Data export capabilities

#### **Step 5: Data Analysis & Lab Report**
- Show auto-generated data tables
- Demonstrate graph creation tools
- Preview lab report template with bilingual prompts

### **Act 3: Assessment & Analytics (4 minutes)**

#### **Step 6: Auto-Graded Assessment**
- Complete sample multiple choice questions
- Show immediate feedback with explanations
- Demonstrate adaptive questioning based on performance

**Sample Questions to Show:**
- "Which variable most affects pendulum period?"
- "What would happen to a pendulum clock on Jupiter?"
- Graph interpretation exercises

#### **Step 7: Teacher Analytics Dashboard**
- Switch to teacher account
- **Email:** `teacher@vlab.edu.kh`
- **Password:** `demo123`

**Show Analytics Features:**
- Real-time student progress tracking
- Common misconception identification
- Time-on-task analytics
- Intervention recommendations

**Narration:**
> "មីហ្សា's teacher, លោកគ្រូ សុខា, immediately sees that 70% of students thought mass affects pendulum motion. This tells him exactly what to address in tomorrow's class discussion."

#### **Step 8: Parent Portal Preview**
- Quick switch to parent account
- **Email:** `parent@vlab.edu.kh`
- **Password:** `demo123`

**Show Parent Features:**
- Child's progress summaries
- Skill development tracking
- Home-school communication tools

### **Act 4: System Administration (2 minutes)**

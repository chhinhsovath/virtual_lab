## Notes
- All exercises were added with teacher_id = 1 (from tbl_teacher_information table)
- The original scripts had to be modified to use INTEGER teacher_id instead of UUID
- All exercises are marked as is_required = true and is_active = true
- Simulations that already had exercises were skipped to avoid duplicates
